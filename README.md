# Predicting the sale price of used cars

- In this jupyter notebook, we will explore kaggle used cars dataset and use it to predict the sale price of used cars. 

- The jupyter notebook is divided into 3 main sections
    - Data Preparation: We will clean the dataset, plot graphs and look at the relationship between each independent variable and the dependant variable. 
    - Data modeling: We will build multiple regression models and compare their R2 score to select the best one.
    - Data evaluation and deployment: We will explore and reflect on the important factors that have contributed to the car's final sales price. 

## Instructions

- To run the code, you will need to first install the necessary libraries: pandas, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and sklearn and jupyter lab. 
- Open the notebook in jupyter lab and run each cell with Shift + Enter.
- The jupyter notebook is in the root and the dataset is inside the data directory.
